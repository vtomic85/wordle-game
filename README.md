# Getting Started with Create React App

## How to Play Wordle

Wordle is a simple word-guessing game. The objective is to guess a hidden five-letter word within six attempts. Here are the basic instructions:

1. Enter a five-letter word as your guess.
2. After each guess, the color of the tiles will change to show how close your guess was to the word:
   - Green: The letter is in the correct position.
   - Yellow: The letter is in the word but in the wrong position.
   - Gray: The letter is not in the word at all.
3. Use the feedback from the colors to make your next guess.
4. Repeat until you either guess the word correctly or run out of attempts.

Enjoy playing and challenge yourself to find the word in as few guesses as possible!

# Technical Info

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
